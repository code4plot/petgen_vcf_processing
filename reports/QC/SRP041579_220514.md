SRP041579 DP QUAL report

## Data input

Data input should be merged vcf files from the variant calling pipeline
with snpeff annotations.

## Parse out information

We are interested in the depth (DP) and quality of variant sites.

``` r
dp <- parse_info(in.vcf, "DP") %>% as.integer()
plot.df <- in.vcf %>% transmute(QUAL = X6, DP = dp)
```

## Visualize distributions

``` r
ggplot(plot.df,
       aes(x = DP)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  theme_bw()
```

  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  theme_bw()
```

Observe that large majority of reads have very small DP. Let’s see what
the quantiles look like.

``` r
quantile(plot.df$DP, seq(0,1,.1)) 
```

    ##    0%   10%   20%   30%   40%   50%   60%   70%   80%   90%  100% 
    ##     1     2     2     3     3     4     5     7    11    55 44849

``` r
quantile(plot.df$QUAL, seq(0,1,.1))
```

    ##         0%        10%        20%        30%        40%        50%        60% 
    ##     30.010     49.280     67.640     73.320     77.320     78.320    106.140 
    ##        70%        80%        90%       100% 
    ##    121.640    159.140    417.696 206232.000

The percentile of DP that resembles some useful depth to use (arbitrary,
but we don’t want something like 10 or so) is 90% percentile of the
data.

Apply filter to retain the top 10% of DP.

``` r
dp_cutoff <- quantile(plot.df$DP, seq(0,1,.1))[10] # starting at 0%, 90% is the 10th element
plot.df <- plot.df %>% 
  filter(DP > dp_cutoff)
```

``` r
ggplot(plot.df,
       aes(x = DP)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  theme_bw()
```

ggplot(plot.df,
       aes(x = QUAL)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  theme_bw()
```

With the DP filter, the QUAL metric is now shifted to the right (from
the original data). Likely, we do not need to apply any further filters,
as the minimum is \~30 (1 in 30 chance of a false result).
